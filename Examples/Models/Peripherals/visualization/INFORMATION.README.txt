INFORMATION -------------------------------------------------------------

This directory contains examples that are using the OVP HTTP Interface to allow
user visualization of components.

These examples all open a port that when connected to by a browser will show
and allow interaction with items such as LED, switches, Alpha Numeric and 
LCD 2x16 displays.

The examples run at full simulation speed and you may wish to add --wallclock
or --wallclockfactor to slow down the simulation to a maximum of real time or a
factor of real time respectively.

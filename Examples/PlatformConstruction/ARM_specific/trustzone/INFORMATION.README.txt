INTRODUCTION -------------------------------------------------------
This directory contains examples from the Imperas ARM TrustZone Platform
Modeling Application Note. It should be used in conjunction with the 
application note but is briefly described here.

This example includes several example platforms illustrating methods to model 
TrustZone aware peripherals in OVP, and applications to run on these platforms.

The set of examples contained in this directory are described in the application
note available in the installation

Imperas/doc/appnotes/Imperas_ARM_TrustZone_Platform_Modeling_Application_Note.pdf

FILES --------------------------------------------------------------
There are several different examples provided, each including:
1. Application - found in the application directory along with a Makefile
2. platform.tcl - describes the example platform for the iGen program to create
3. Makefile - compiles the application, builds the platform and runs it

PREREQUISITES ------------------------------------------------------

-- ARM Cross Compiler ----------------------------------------------

To use the provided Makefiles you will need to install the armv7 toolchain 
package available from the download page of the OVPworld website at:

A CPU core may be configured to instance many processors of a Symmetrical
Multi Processor (SMP). A CPU core may also have sub elements within a processor, for
example hardware threading blocks. \par
OVP processor models can be written to include SMP blocks and to have many levels of
hierarchy. \par
Some OVP CPU models may have a fixed hierarchy, and some may be configured by settings
in a configuration register. Please see the register definitions of this model. \par
This model documentation shows the settings and hierarchy of the default settings for this
model variant. \par
